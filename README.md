## 🚀 Installation

To use these code snippets, you will need to import them into your text editor's snippet library. The process for doing this will vary depending on the text editor you are using. Please consult your text editor's documentation for instructions on how to import code snippets.

## 🔨 Usage

Once you have imported the code snippets into your text editor, you can use them by typing the prefix of the snippet you want to use and then pressing the tab key. The snippet will be inserted into your code, and you can then fill in the placeholders with your own code.
